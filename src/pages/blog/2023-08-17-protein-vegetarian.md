I travel and meet my old friends in different cities. Often it is the case, that a lot has changed since we last met however, one characteristics of mine remain unchanged -- my preference to eat no meat. I have been a vegetarian all my life. I will write a separate blog on how it all started but for the this one, I am sticking to the question some of my friends have asked me -- But where do you get your protein from, bro?

Well, friends, there are really a lot of alternative sources of protein and if anything, its hard to choose **because** there are a lot of options. 

### Quinoa
  Cooking quinoa is plain and simple -- add water to quinoa and boil it until its simmer and then serve! Obviously, I eat to live and not live to eat.

### Tofu
  
  [My go-to Tofu pack](https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/organic-firm-tofu-041911). Its firm, its cheap, its healthy and its delicious. Sorry that probably sounds like an Ad. 
### Egg
  
  I probably don't need to explain much here. I make mushroom omlette sometimes and eat it with Tofu! 
### Temfeh
  
  Again, the one at Trader Joe's is great but might be available in other stores too. 
### Bean and Lentils
  
  I obviously need to do better here because I have been depending a lot on the lentils from Trader's joe again but whenever I am not travelling (which has been rare these days), I want to start using instant pot to make lentils.

  | When I am travelling | When I am at home |
  | ------------- | ------------- |

### Seitan
  
  I only learnt about Seitan a couple of years back. Turns out some people even call it "Vegan Steak". Fun Fact: In hinduism, "shaitan" is the power-seeking demons. So just pronounce it right.  

  | Shaitan | Seitan |

### Chickpea  
Think of chana masala! Here is the [receipe I follow](https://www.indianhealthyrecipes.com/chana-masala/)  
### Nuts including Almonds

I am one of the worst cooks out there. I went to a boarding school for almost 10 years and I was so dependent on the kitchen staff for serving us their best receipes. And then I continued being spoilt by going to a college with one of the best cafeterias in the US. They were a lot of options to choose from so I never really had to worry to make my own food. After graduation, my cooking journey took a massive turn and I have been trying out my own receipes since then. Some of my favorites include Sweet Potato Coconut Red Curry https://www.saltandlavender.com/thai-sweet-potato-coconut-red-curry/, Mushroom Alfredo Cauliflower Gnocchi https://themodernproper.com/mushroom-alfredo-cauliflower-gnocchi or sometimes straight up just Tofu, Lentils with Baby Spinach because because let me say this - its hard to think about food when I am writing and reviewing code, ADRs and PRDs. Its not easy. So friends help me out by sharing what has been your go-to favorite receipes. 


Btw the below hacks have helped me with my cooking journey:
* Airfryer
* [an egg boiler](/img/egg-boiler.jpeg) 
* [an onion chopper](/img/onion-chopper.jpeg) because there are so many other reasons to cry - onions don't have to be one of them.
