description: 71% of the earth's surface is water. I had read it but only after visiting Hawaii, I became fully aware that there really is a lot of water on Earth. And hence I signed up for swimming lessons.

71% of the Earth's surface is water. No I did know that already, it was not new. But knowing something is different from experiencing it. 


I felt so godly. I remember watching Indra moving through clouds in Ramayana and Mahabharata in our family' black and white television. On the left is Indra and on the right is me making my way to the earth through the clouds. Do you see how similar it looks?
