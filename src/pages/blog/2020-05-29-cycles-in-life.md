description: We come across several cycles in life and some are difficult to get out of. But it is important that we recognise these cycles and break them.

I can think of 3 types of cycles.

### 1. Bi-cycle

But this cycle is not what I am talking about.

### 2. Saṃsāra - cycle of death and rebirth
    
Now if you are a "true" hindu (and I have always wanted to be), you might see this as the cycle of life. After death, unless you attain Mokshya, you are born again; may be in a different body. I won't get into more details as I hardly know much on this topic.

But keep those cycles away for now. I want to talk about a different cycle.

### 3. Cycle that we all come across but might not realize

We come across several cycles in our lifetime and we can idenity them if we are aware about it. Applying for a driver's license in the US is a cycle, applying for a new job after graduation is a cycle and being racist is also a cycle.
 
### 1 Driver's License Cycle

To get a driver's license, you need to learn how to drive. But to learn how to drive, you need to have a car. And you need a license to buy a car. That's a Cycle.

I took my driving knowledge test in my Junior year. But to actually take the road test, it did not happen until I finally graduated and had enough money to buy a car. Thanks to my brother too who contributed a significant percentage of it. Having a driver's license was a requirement to buy a car from the dealers. And I did not have the license. So I instead posted in Craigslist and found a person who sold me their car and did not ask for a license. I found a way to break the cycle - bought the car first via Craiglist and practiced driving and took the road test; passed after 2 failed attempts and finally had my license!  

Once I had the license, I never really thought much about how difficult it was to get a license. I have realized that it is so easy to forget once we are out of the cycle.

Such cycles come cross our lives more than we might think. I came across another cycle when appling for my first job after graduation.

### 2 Job Cycle - "You need to have 5 years of work experience to get your first job!" 

When I was applying for my first job, I was really surprised that a lot of the jobs I applied to expected me to have years of prior experience. Thats another cycle - to get your first job, you need to have a job already. How did I break this cycle? I worked on multiple projects and pushed my code to github. I connected with recruiters in Minneapolis and told them about myself and my skills. I asked for recommendations at companies where I knew someone. I failed multiple interviews and passed a few - including at United Health but later learnt that they were not comfortable with my OPT status. Moved on. After 6 rounds of interview at a startup in Minneapolis, I finally my first job.

Few months during my first job, I began receiving emails from recuiters who wanted to hire me. Once I got out of that cycle, finding a second job was not that difficult.

Driving License and Job cycles are not that difficult to break. There are loop holes and properly applied techniques got me out of those cycles. But it seems not all cycles are that easy to get out from. One of the most difficult cycles to break is the cycle of racism. The recent murder of George Floyd and protests for racial equality even in 2020s shows how deeply racism is embedded in our society.

### 3. Cycle of Racism

Racism is a cycle. If you don't do any work to get out this cycle, you might never get out of it. You have to constanly push yourself to come out this cycle. 

In Minnesota where George Floyd was murdered, the highest penalty for knowingly using counterfeit money less than $1,000 is up to one year in prison and a fine up to $3,000. I always ask to myself why did Derek Chauvin kneel on George Floyd's neck? And why did the other 3 police officers do nothing about it?To me, it was not really about the suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill, it was more about what the minds of police officers were filled up with - about this black person - George Floyd. Their minds were loaded with prejudices and George did not have to say anything to make them angry. By kneeling on his neck of more than 8 mins and killing him leads me to compare George as a "dalit" who has been beaten by this upper caste Derek Chauvin. Sorry I am using the caste system reference here but that is because I am familiar to it and it seems similar at some level. Take for instance the [story](https://tkpo.st/3evOwPh) of Navaraj B.K who was beaten to death because the Dalit boy dared to love an upper-caste girl. The upper castes people in this village killed him because he was a BK, a Bishwokarma,a Dalit. Derek Chauvin kneeled on George Floyd's neck not because of the counterfeit $20 bill but because Geroge was a black man. The upper cases in Navaraj village did not beat him to death because he had falled in love with a girl but because he was a dalit. Derek and the upper caste people in Navaraj's village are the victims of the racism cycle that they have not been able to break. They did not seem to have done enough to come out of it. 

Unlike the other two cycles - the cycle of license and the cycle of finding a job, the cycle of racism is much more difficult. And it takes agressive and continuous effort to break it. I did not do a PhD in Racial Studies so I am not sure how opinions about race changes but I would say this - lets start by connecting with folks from different backgounds, having open and mindful conversations with them and admitting your ignorance and being intellectually honest about your prejudices and wanting to hear different opinions. There are books, there are podcasts, there is Internet and there are people. Read, listen, browse and connect. 

I would love to hear about more cycles that you have come across in your life. Let me know via comments.
