I am forunate that I have not been laid off from my current job. However when scrolling my Linkedin News Feed, I could see a lot of posts about layoffs. And it gets more difficult for people who are on visas. They have limited time to find another job. As someone who sacrificed family love and local language & culture since an early age to pursue my educational dreams, I can't imagine losing all of that in a moment. This is difficult time for everyone in the world and especially for those who are living in a country other than their own. 

I have compiled some resources that are still hiring despite the COVID-19 layoffs. I will be happy if either of these links would help you. Please reach to me personally as well and I can definiely share resumes in my network.

Sending resumes in a black hole has hardly gotten me a response. Responses after applying for jobs in Indeed, Dice, Glassdoor CyberCoder, LinkedIn have taken quite a while and in most cases never heard back. Instead I have changed my approach to send messages to people on slack and the respones have been pretty satisfying. Below are the slack groups of several cities and there is a "job" channel in each group and some posts about companies that are hiring. I hope that helps.
